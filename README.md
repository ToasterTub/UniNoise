# UniNoise
A quick and simple image noise and pattern generator for Unity (Editor)

Drag and drop the UniNoise folder into your Assets folder in a Unity project.

Go to Window/UniNoise to use it.

In the top right of the Editor Window there's a little information button. Click that to learn more!

(I'll add images here soon)
